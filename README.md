# Angle Trisection Demo

A GeoGebra-based interactive model to demonstrate the classical geometric method of trisecting an angle using a **parabola and a circular arc**.

## 🔍 Description

This model illustrates how an arbitrary angle can be divided into three equal parts using purely geometric constructions. It is based on the intersection of a parabola and a circular arc, and visualizes each step clearly for educational and research purposes.
